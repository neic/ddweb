    <p>We started our own company when the management of Danish Interior
      A/S, decided to cease operations in Denmark. Danish Decoration, Ship
      Interior Consulting ApS, referred to as “Danish Decoration” was
      established on July 4th, 2008. All the principals have been working
      with various companies in the cruise business for twenty years or
      more. We have all worked in various positions as Project Manager,
      On-Site Manager and Assistant Project Manager. This is also the reason
      for the way we have built our Reference List. As Danish Decoration is
      a young company it may look a little odd with this many references. We
      have simply listed the major part of the various projects where we
      personally have held a position. Danish Decoration has begun well by
      signing long term contracts with R&amp;M Ship Tec Group. Our goal is
      to establish new partners while continuing the existing relations we
      have developed. We offer Project Management services related to
      interior refurbishment in public areas on cruise ships and ferries.
      We also specialize in consulting and procurement services.  We have
      great experience both on new buildings and on Refits, and we offer
      both.</p>
